HiddenButton Web Application
Overview
The HiddenButton web application is a simple game. The application features two main components: a set of three buttons where one is randomly assigned as the winner, and a 
dynamic button generator where users can specify the number of buttons to be generated, with one randomly selected as the winner upon generation.
